- 👋 Hi, I’m @StefanoPalliggianoDL. My name is pronounced "**Ste**fano", with stress falling on the first syllable.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data visualisation, machine learning, Generative AI and Natural Language Processing (and everything language-related in general).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to introduce LLM models to production (LLMOps).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any data science or machine learning project that will deliver value to DLL.
- 📫 You can reach me at stefano.palliggiano.at.davidlloyd.co.uk
